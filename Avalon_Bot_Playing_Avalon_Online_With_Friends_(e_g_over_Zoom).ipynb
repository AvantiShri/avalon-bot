        "Hello, I'm Av, and I wrote a bot to help with playing [Avalon](https://hobbylark.com/card-games/How-to-Play-Avalon) remotely with friends. This bot will do the initial Avalon card assignments and will also give players any privileged information they need to know (e.g. it will tell Merlin the names of the people on the Evil team that Merlin is allowed to know). In this Google Colab notebook, I'll show you how to use this bot yourself. No programming experience required.\n",

For this account you create, you should go to [https://myaccount.google.com/u/4/lesssecureapps](https://myaccount.google.com/u/4/lesssecureapps?pageId=none) and set \"Allow less secure apps: ON\" (if you don't do this, the bot won't be able to use that email). I've shown what it looks like in the screenshot below. Btw I recommend you create a new account and **don't use your personal email account** precisely because you have to lower the security settings.\n",

Have someone who is not on the quest count down from three, and then have the people on the quest enter their votes (yes or no) simultaneously.\n",
